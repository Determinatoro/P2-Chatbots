\subsection{C\#}\label{subsec:Csharp}

The chatbot designed in this report will be implemented using C\#. C\# is an object-oriented programming language, which runs on the .NET framework and was designed to be reminiscent of languages like C++ and Java. It was developed in the early 2000's and was designed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft. Currently, it is one of the most popular programming languages, with approximately 31\% of all developers using it regularly \cite{ArminaMkhitaryan2017WhyWorld}. C\# can be used for creating Windows client applications, web services, database applications and more \cite{2015IntroductionDocs}.

As mentioned, C\# runs on the .NET framework. A framework in programming is a collection of \newacr{Application Programming Interfaces}{API's} allowing a piece of software to interact with other software through a shared library of code, programmers can use. In addition to this, the .NET framework provides a runtime environment for the code when it is executed, known as the \newacr{Common language runtime}{CLR} \cite{WalterGlenn2017WhatPC}. The CLR, among other things, helps with things like monitoring memory use, handling exceptions in code and managing security.
