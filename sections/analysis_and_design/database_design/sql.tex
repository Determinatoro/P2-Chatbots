\subsubsection{SQL}

SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to \newacr{American National Standards Institute}{ANSI} it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data in a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as \enquote{Select}, \enquote{Insert}, \enquote{Update}, \enquote{Delete}, \enquote{Create}, and \enquote{Drop} can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.

%A relational database system contains one or more objects called tables. The data or information in the database are stored in these tables. Tables are uniquely identified by their names and are comprised of columns and rows. Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes for the column and rows contain the records or data for the columns.
