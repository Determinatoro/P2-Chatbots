\subsubsection{Triggers}
For the MathChatBot triggers have been used for the ordering of assignments, definitions and examples. A trigger is a stored order procedure that is run when a specific order is run in the database. Triggers can be made to run before, instead or after a data manipulation command such as insert, update or delete is used. The ordering of the definitions and examples are all printed when asked for either for a topic or a term. This means that the trigger arranges in what order the assignments and definitions are presented. The assignments on the other hand are only printed 1 at a time, with an option of pressing a \enquote{Next} button for the next assignment. In the MathChatBot only users with the title \enquote{Admin} are allowed to rearrange the order of assignments, definitions and examples.
