\subsection{LINQ}
One of the queries mentioned in the Entity Framework subsection is the query language LINQ, which is also the query language which will be used for this project. LINQ provides many tools for working with data, LINQ is similar to SQL which is a topic that will be covered later in this report. The difference is that LINQ can be used on data which is not stored in databases. Just like in SQL LINQ uses query expressions to manipulate data.
