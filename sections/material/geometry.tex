\section{Geometry}
Geometry on Mathematical C level deals figures in a 2- or 3 dimensional and generally only comes around 3 subtopics; units, area and volume and surface area. In this section, it will be covered what methods that will be used in the software product.

\subsection{Units}


\[1m*1m = (1m)^2 = 1^2 m^2 = 1m^2\]

\[(1m)^2 = (100cm)^2 = 100^2cm^2=10.000cm^2\]
