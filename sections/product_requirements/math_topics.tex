\label{sec:math_topics}

Since the project will focus on making a chatbot capable of helping students with C level math it must have knowledge of the different topics C level math contains. The different topics in math C have been defined by the Danish government \cite{2017Matematik-C-stx-august-2017} and of the subjects, the chatbot designed in this project will be able to help with some, if not all, of the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate calculation, order of operations, proportionality, and equation solving
\item Percentage and interest rate calculation
\item Statistical methods for handling data material.
\item Combinatorics and probability
\item Analytic description of lines and circles.
\item Definition and interpretation of derivative value
\item Functions, including linear, exponential and power regression
\item Determination of a tangent, monotonics interval and extrema of functions, in limited intervals
\end{itemize}
